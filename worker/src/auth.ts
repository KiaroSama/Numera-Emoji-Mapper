 * Who may talk to this Worker, and who the bots answer.

 * Two separate gates, and they are not interchangeable:

 *   - `isAdmin` decides whether the human behind an update gets a reply.
 *
 * Both fail CLOSED. An unset or malformed allowlist means "nobody", never
 * "everybody" -- the same rule the Python bot's `allowed_user_ids()` follows,
 * because a misconfiguration must not silently open the bot to the world.
