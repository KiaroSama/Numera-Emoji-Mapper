## Local development

```powershell
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
# Everything the check gate needs, in one line (core, coins, ruff, playwright):
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-coins.txt -r requirements-dev.txt; .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m playwright install chromium
.\run.ps1 -Check      # environment doctor (non-interactive)
.\scripts\check.ps1   # byte-compile + ruff + full unit suite — what CI runs
.\scripts\check.ps1 -Tests test_catalog,test_panel_plan -SkipCompile -SkipLint   # chosen suites only
```

`check.ps1` names the one install command above and exits 2 if anything it
needs is missing. `-Tests` runs suites as `tests.<name>`, so the test guard in
`tests/__init__.py` still applies.

Lint is `ruff check .` with no arguments; `ruff.toml` at the repo root owns the
rule set and the exclusions. Do not pass `--select`/`--exclude` on the command
line and do not silence a finding with `--exit-zero` — a lint stage that cannot
fail is worse than none.

Run `scripts\check.ps1` before every commit rather than a hand-written
`unittest` command: the suite must be started as
`python -m unittest discover -s tests -t . -p "test_*.py"`, and dropping `-t .`
disables the test-suite credential/network guard (see
[`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md)).

Keep code comments and documentation in English, match the existing style, and
never commit `.env`, `secrets.md`, or any real credentials.
