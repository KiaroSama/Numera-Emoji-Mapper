"""Write the published packs' emoji rosters to ``packs/``, for humans and machines.

One file pair per live set -- ``packs/<set>.md`` to read and ``packs/<set>.json``
to parse -- plus ``packs/index.json`` and ``packs/README.md`` over the whole
estate. Two families are covered: the general packs built by
``build_collection.py`` and the 29 crypto packs built by ``coins/``.

**The order and the ids come from TELEGRAM, never from a state file.** A pack can
be reordered live (``sync_order.py``), an emoji can be replaced in place, and a
replacement MINTS A NEW custom_emoji_id -- so a roster rebuilt from the recorded
plan would drift the moment any of that happens, silently, which is exactly the
kind of wrong-but-plausible file this is meant to prevent. ``getStickerSet``
answers what is actually there, in the actual order.

Provenance is the one thing Telegram cannot tell us, so it is joined in:
* general -- ``premium-id:<n>`` keywords, recorded by ``fetch_emoji_ids.py``,
  give the id the emoji had in the pack we took it from;
* coins -- ``coins/ticker_to_id.json`` gives the ticker each logo stands for.

Slot 1 of every general pack is the brand logo. It has no catalog row (it is not
an ingested item), which is why the older ``collection/manifests`` left its id
blank -- reading the live set fixes that for free, and the owner asked for it
explicitly.

Usage::

    python -m emojikit.pack_manifest --refresh              # read live, rewrite packs/
    python -m emojikit.pack_manifest --refresh --family coins
    python -m emojikit.pack_manifest --check                # stale? exit 3. No network.
