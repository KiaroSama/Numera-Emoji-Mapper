"""Interactive Numera Emoji Mapper bot (general bot, long-polling).

Capabilities:
  1. Send the bot a premium (custom) emoji -> it replies with the emoji's id on
     a tap-to-copy inline button.
  2. Send/forward a post that mixes text + premium emoji -> it lists every
     custom_emoji_id; tapping a button copies all of them at once.
  3. Add the bot to a group/channel -> for every NEW post it sees there, it DMs
     the owner the premium emoji ids (tap to copy). NOTE: the Bot API cannot read
     channel history, so only posts received after the bot joined are processed.

"Tap to copy" uses Telegram's CopyTextButton (Bot API 9.0): an inline button
with ``copy_text`` copies its text to the clipboard on click.

Run:  python -m emojikit.emoji_bot        (uses GENERAL_BOT_TOKEN from .env)
