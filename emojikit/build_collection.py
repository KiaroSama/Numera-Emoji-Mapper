"""Publish the catalog into new Telegram custom-emoji packs (multi-format).

Reads pending emoji from the content-addressed catalog and uploads them into
fresh custom-emoji sets owned by the configured user, with a new base name and
title. Static, animated and video emoji are published into SEPARATE sets by
default for organization/clarity. NOTE: since Bot API 7.2 (March 2024) a single
set MAY contain mixed formats, so this split is a choice, not a requirement --
the brand logo (static) is added as the first emoji of every set regardless of
the set's format.

Duplicate-proof & resumable:

* A FROZEN, append-only plan (``publish_plan_<base>.json``) fixes the upload
  order per format, so resume is deterministic.
* Progress is reconciled from LIVE Telegram counts (sum of stickers actually
  present), exactly like the coin rebuild tool -> interrupting and resuming can
  never create a duplicate. ``pending = plan[fmt][live_total:]``.

Usage:
  python -m emojikit.build_collection --base mypack --title "My Pack" \
      [--token-env GENERAL_BOT_TOKEN] [--user-id N] [--emoji 😀] \
      [--formats static,video,animated] [--per-set 200] [--data-dir collection] \
      [--dry-run]
