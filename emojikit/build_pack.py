"""Create Telegram premium custom-emoji pack(s) from a folder of PNG images.

This is the generic Numera Emoji Mapper engine: it uploads every 100x100 PNG found in a
source directory into one or more Telegram custom-emoji sets. It is NOT tied to
cryptocurrency coins -- point ``--source-dir`` at any folder of prepared PNGs
(see make_emoji_pngs.py) to build a pack of arbitrary emojis.

A bot can create a custom-emoji set OWNED by a user, so you need:
  - a bot token (env or .env)                -> selected with --token-env
  - PACK_OWNER_USER_ID  (env, or --user-id)  -> your numeric Telegram user id
  - You must have pressed Start on that bot at least once.

Two bots are configured by default:
  - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN  -> the original crypto-coin bot (default)
  - GENERAL_BOT_TOKEN   -> @YourEmojiBot, for general (non-coin) packs

Telegram limits each custom-emoji set to 200 emojis, so the images are split
into multiple sets named ``<base><n>_by_<botusername>``. Each emoji is given an
associated standard emoji (--emoji) and optional searchable keywords (from a
keywords.csv mapping ``ticker -> keywords``; falls back to the file name).

Usage (crypto coins, original bot):
  python -m emojikit.build_pack --base cryptoemoji --title "@YourBrand Crypto Emoji" \
      [--user-id 123] [--emoji ߞ] [--limit N] [--start N] [--dry-run]

Usage (general pack, new bot):
  python -m emojikit.build_pack --base mystickers --title "My Emojis" \
      --source-dir build/myset --token-env GENERAL_BOT_TOKEN --emoji ߘ

Run with --dry-run first to validate inputs without calling Telegram.
