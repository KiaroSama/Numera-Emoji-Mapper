Its own module because `video_decode` has to RAISE one and `media` imports

    """A video's identity-grade decode could not be ESTABLISHED.

    Not the same claim as "this file is broken". It also covers "the toolchain
    could not prove it read the alpha" -- a probe that failed, a codec the
    container would not name, an ffmpeg with no decoder for a format that keeps
    transparency in a separate layer.

    It exists because the alternative is worse than an error. Degrading to a
    plain decode loses alpha silently, and two clips differing only in opacity
    then share one content key: `Catalog.add` merges on an equal key and
    `_drop_unreferenced` deletes the file it merged away. An unknown identity
    must never reach the catalog, so this is raised instead of guessed.

    A `MediaError` subclass on purpose: every ingest site already fails one item
    on `MediaError`/`RuntimeError` and counts it, so an undecodable video is
    skipped and reported rather than silently absorbed.
