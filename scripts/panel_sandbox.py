"""Start the curate panel against a THROWAWAY COPY of the catalog.

Why this exists, plainly: an agent verifying the panel in a browser fired
synthetic drag events at the panel that was serving the owner's real
`collection/` directory. Every one of those drags called `/api/order` and
rewrote `items.position` in the live catalog, on top of an afternoon of manual
ordering. Reordering is exactly what the panel is for, so there is no way to
"test carefully" against real data -- the test IS the mutation.

So automated UI checks get their own catalog, their own port, and their own
credentials-free environment:

* the catalog is CLONED by `emojikit.sandbox_clone` -- its own database bytes,
  its own media bytes, every path repointed -- and the clone is deleted on exit;
* its port is the real panel's + 1, taken from the shared `cli_env.PANEL_PORT` rather than
  typed again, so a sandbox can never take the port a real panel is on and a
  real panel is never mistaken for the sandbox;
* the arguments are an ALLOWLIST. This used to forward unknown options straight
  to the panel, after its own `--data-dir`, so `panel_sandbox.py --data-dir
  collection` served the owner's live catalog while this file printed that the
  live catalog was not served. Nothing is forwarded now; the panel's argument
  list is built here, explicitly;
* the installed native panel runs in a private owned process tree. The wrapper
  stops and reaps that tree before releasing the clone's lifetime lease; a fresh
  clone's session identity cannot match another listener.

Usage (this is what `.claude/launch.json` runs):

    .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe scripts/panel_sandbox.py
    .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe scripts/panel_sandbox.py --source collection --port 8766
    .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe scripts/panel_sandbox.py --all      # published packs too
