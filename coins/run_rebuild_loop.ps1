# Self-restarting runner for the deduplicated pack rebuild.
# Repeatedly runs the resumable, duplicate-proof 'build' phase until it reports
# completion, then maps cids + fills inventory and sends final links.
# Safe to interrupt and re-run: build reconciles progress from live Telegram counts.
#
# 'build' exit codes: 0 = whole plan walked, 3 = more work left (resume me).
# Anything else is terminal (bad usage, missing token, unreadable state) and
# retrying it only burns Telegram API calls, so the loop stops instead.
