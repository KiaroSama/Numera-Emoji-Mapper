"""Final integrity check across ALL emoji packs.

Downloads every sticker from every pack, then reports:
  - BLANK stickers: fully transparent / effectively empty images
  - DUPLICATE stickers: distinct stickers (different custom_emoji_id) whose images
    are pixel-identical (same logo uploaded more than once)

Note: aliases that point multiple inventory tickers at ONE custom_emoji_id are NOT
duplicates -- that is a single shared sticker. Only distinct cids with identical
images count as duplicates here.

Resumable: per-sticker results are cached in pack_audit.json so a re-run after an
interruption (timeout / Telegram rate limit) continues instead of restarting. The
report is always derived from the CURRENT live manifest, so a deleted sticker
leaves the totals and duplicate groups, and a sticker that failed to download or
decode is recorded as an error and retried on the next run instead of being
cached forever as "blank".
