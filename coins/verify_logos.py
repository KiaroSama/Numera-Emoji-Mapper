"""Review (and precisely fix) coin logos against official CoinGecko art.

Coin tickers are shared by many tokens, so a logo fetched by symbol can be the
wrong coin (e.g. a green "SOL" token instead of Solana). This tool pulls the
top-N coins by market cap, compares each one's official logo to the local source
logo (``<symbol>.png``) with a perceptual hash, and lists candidates that differ.

IMPORTANT: a large perceptual distance does NOT prove a logo is wrong. Many
correct logos come from different icon sets (different art) than CoinGecko, so
they differ too. Treat the report as a REVIEW list for a human, not ground
truth. Fixing is therefore restricted to an explicit, user-confirmed ticker list
(``--fix --only sym1,sym2``) so correct logos are never clobbered.

Usage:
  python coins/verify_logos.py --emoji-dir "PATH/emoji" [--top 100]
  python coins/verify_logos.py --emoji-dir "PATH/emoji" --fix --only sol,xrp
