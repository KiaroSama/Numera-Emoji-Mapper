"""Rebuild ticker_to_id.json by matching live pack images to source logos.

Why this exists: the original mapping was built from the dedup *plan order*, but
the live packs contain images in a slightly different order (some plan items were
skipped/failed during upload, shifting every later position). As a result the
position-based ticker->custom_emoji_id table is misaligned from the first gap
onward, so many tickers point at the wrong sticker.

This tool ignores position entirely and re-derives the mapping from image
content: it downloads every live sticker once, computes a small perceptual
signature, and matches each local source logo (``<ticker>.png``) to the live
sticker whose image is most similar. The result is a corrected, content-based
ticker -> custom_emoji_id map. It NEVER modifies the Telegram packs.

Usage:
  # 1. dry run: prints the distance/margin distribution used to calibrate the cutoff
  python coins/remap_ids.py --emoji-dir "PATH/TO/emoji"
  # 2. apply, with a calibrated cutoff (required)
  python coins/remap_ids.py --emoji-dir "PATH/TO/emoji" --max-distance 150 --apply

``--apply`` refuses to overwrite the canonical map from incomplete or ambiguous
data and writes a reviewable candidate file instead.

Both phases run under the coin pack-family lock -- the same one the fetchers and
rebuild_dedup take before touching those sets -- because the live read has to
still describe the live packs at the moment the map is replaced. If a provider
run holds it this exits EXIT_FAILED without writing anything; re-run afterwards.

Resumable: live signatures are cached in remap_live_cache.json keyed by set name
plus a digest of that set's live sticker manifest, so an interrupted run
continues without re-downloading while an edited pack is still re-read.
