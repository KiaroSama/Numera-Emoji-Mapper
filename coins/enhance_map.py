"""Improve inventory coverage: map chain-suffixed tickers to the base logo.

Many inventory tickers are the same coin on another chain (e.g. 1inchbsc,
avaxc, bnbbsc, brettbase, chiparb). The base coin's logo exists, so strip known
network suffixes and reuse the base ticker's custom_emoji_id, then re-fill.
