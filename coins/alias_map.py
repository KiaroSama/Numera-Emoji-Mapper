"""Fill more inventory tickers by matching coin NAME to an existing logo.

For each still-blank inventory ticker, normalize its coin name (drop chain info
in parentheses and generic words) and look up a logo with the same normalized
name. Safe: it only matches when the coin NAMES agree AND exactly one logo
answers to that normalized name; anything ambiguous is reported and left
unmapped rather than guessed. Then it re-fills the inventory.
