"""Full, deduplicated rebuild of all custom-emoji packs (Option B).

Deletes every existing pack and rebuilds from scratch so that:
  - NO two stickers share the same image (deduplicated by image content), and
  - every coin that shares a logo with others is still represented: all its
    tickers map to the single shared sticker, and that sticker's keywords merge
    the coins' tickers/names (up to Telegram's keyword budget); the full coin
    list per shared image is saved to shared_logo_groups.json.

Design:
  - A FROZEN plan (rebuild_dedup_plan.json) lists one representative image per
    distinct image hash, in a fixed order. This is the canonical upload list, so
    resume is deterministic and can never create a duplicate.
  - Progress is reconciled from LIVE Telegram counts (sum of stickers actually
    present), so interrupting and resuming can never create a duplicate.
  - Pack base and titles are the operator's COIN_PACK_BASE and COIN_PACK_TITLE
    ('<title> N'); a fresh base avoids name-reuse conflicts with deleted packs.

Usage:
  python rebuild_dedup.py            # build plan (if needed) + delete old + build + map
  python rebuild_dedup.py map        # skip building; map live cids + fill inventory
  python rebuild_dedup.py links      # (re)send the final combined links message
