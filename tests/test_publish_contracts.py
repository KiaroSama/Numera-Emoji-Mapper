"""Publisher contracts that are NOT about build_collection's state machine.

Split out of ``test_build_collection_state.py`` because these derive from plain
``unittest.TestCase`` and never touch ``_CatalogFixture`` -- pack naming, the
blank-video guard, and the announcement contract shared by all three
publishers. That last one reaches into ``coins.rebuild_dedup``, so it was never
"collection state" at all.

It also repairs a real defect the split exposed: the original module had
``if __name__ == "__main__": unittest.main()`` sitting ABOVE its last two
classes, so running the file directly collected 93 of its 102 tests and still
printed OK. Discover was unaffected, which is why it stayed invisible.
