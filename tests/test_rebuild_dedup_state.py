"""Regression tests for the rebuild state machine in coins/rebuild_dedup.py.

Each test pins one way the rebuild used to keep mutating packs after it had
stopped knowing what was live:

* an ambiguous upload was followed by the next upload, whose in-flight marker
  overwrote the record of the unresolved one (C-05),
* a failed live read counted as "0 stickers", which rolls the cursor back onto
  an entry that already landed (C-06),
* an old pack that survived deletion still completed the delete phase (H-15),
* a truncated plan file was read as the whole (frozen) plan (M-13),
* two runs could mutate one pack family at the same time (H-05),
* a retryable upload failure consuming the plan position forever (12),
* an in-flight upload judged "landed" by a count any stranger's sticker
  satisfies (13),
* a legacy in-flight marker accepted at validation and then unresolvable
  forever at recovery (B),
* a create recovery adopting a set of the wrong SHAPE, after it had already
  written the adoption to disk (C).

This module covers the mutation walk: plan -> validate -> delete the old packs
-> upload. The canonical map that the walk hands off to is a separate phase of
the same module and lives in `test_rebuild_dedup_map`.

No network and no real sleeps: Telegram is a fake object.
