"""The documented lock order and non-reentrancy, enforced mechanically.

Two rules govern every mutating tool in this repository:

1. **Order.** The pack-family lock is taken FIRST, `canonical_map_lock()` second.
   A tool that only rewrites the canonical map takes the map lock alone. Any path
   that takes them the other way round can deadlock against a provider holding
   them in the documented order.
2. **Non-reentrancy.** `build_pack.exclusive_lock` is a file lock with an
   ownership token; it is NOT reentrant. Acquiring a lock a function already
   holds -- directly or through a helper it calls -- cannot succeed.

Both rules are invisible to anyone reading a single file: the violation lives in
the pairing of a caller in one module with a helper in another. Reviews miss that
kind of defect reliably, and the last two audits both found one. So this checks
it by walking the AST of every tool instead of trusting a reader.

Deliberately AST-only: no imports, no execution, no network. It sees code that
never runs in the suite just as well as code that does.
