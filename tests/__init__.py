"""Test package guard: no test may touch the real network or real credentials.

This exists because it already went wrong. During an automated repair pass a
test that was only meant to exercise a CLI *usage-error* path reached far enough
into the real code to call Telegram, with a real token present in the
environment, and replaced a sticker in a live production pack.

Importing this package (which ``unittest discover -s tests`` always does) makes
that impossible:

* every credential-shaped environment variable is scrubbed, so even a code path
  that ignores its injected fake cannot authenticate;
* outbound sockets are refused, so a missed fake surfaces as a loud, obvious
  error inside the test instead of a silent live mutation.

Tests that legitimately exercise transport behaviour inject a fake session or
patch ``requests``; none of them opens a real connection, so nothing here needs
an opt-out. If a future test genuinely needs one, add a narrow, named context
manager rather than removing the guard.
