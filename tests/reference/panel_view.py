    An emoji already live in a pack is hidden by default: the grid is what the
    NEXT pack gets made of, and `is_published` skips those items at publish
    time however they are ticked here, so showing them only invites pruning
    work that changes nothing.

    This was "hide only a FULL set" for one round, on the theory that a set
    still being filled is still the pack being built. `--new-set` ended that --
    a pack can now be left half-empty on purpose, so "full" stopped meaning
    "finished" and the owner kept meeting an abandoned pack's emoji in the grid
    for the next one. Being published is the property that actually settles it,
    and it needs no state file and no capacity arithmetic.

    Hidden, never deleted -- those rows are what dedup recognises a re-download
    by, what maps a source premium id to ours, and what `sync_order` reads to
    re-sort a live set. ``show_published`` (``python -m emojikit.panel --all``) brings them
    back, which is how you reorder a pack that is already published.

    ``keep_sets`` (``python -m emojikit.panel --with-pack N``) is the narrow version of that:
    it un-hides ONE published set so its emoji can be arranged beside the new
    candidates going into it. `--all` is the wrong tool for that -- it also
    brings back every finished pack, which here is hundreds of cards you cannot
    act on.
