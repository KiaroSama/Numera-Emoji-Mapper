"""Local web panel to review/curate downloaded emoji before publishing.

Opens a dark neon-blue panel in the browser showing every emoji in the catalog
as a large card with a label. All are selected (included) by default; click a
card to toggle it (deselected = excluded from the next publish). Visually
similar emoji are ordered next to each other (greedy nearest-neighbour on the
perceptual hash) so you can deselect look-alikes quickly. "Save" writes the
selection back to the catalog; build_collection then only publishes included
items.

Run:  python -m emojikit.panel   (serves http://127.0.0.1:9450 and opens it)
