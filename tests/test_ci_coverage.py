"""A suite that exists on disk but runs nowhere is worse than no suite.

The Python matrix runs full discovery, so an ordinary new module is covered the
moment it is written. The browser suites are the exception: they opt out of the
matrix (`NUMERA_EMOJI_MAPPER_NO_BROWSER_TESTS=1`, because they test JavaScript and
would download Chromium once per Python version) and run in their own job from
a HAND-MAINTAINED list of module names.

A hand-maintained list is the thing that silently goes stale, so this is the
mechanical guard over it. Adding `tests/test_panel_queues.py` without adding it
to that line would have left fourteen tests passing locally and running nowhere
in CI.

Plain text, not YAML: pulling a parser in for one `run:` line would add a
dependency to the suite, and the assertion is only "does this module name
appear in that step".
