"""Fitting an image onto the 100x100 canvas must not touch its opacity.

F11. `fit_100` pasted the image using ITSELF as the mask, which is a composite
against the transparent canvas underneath: colour came back multiplied by alpha
and alpha came back multiplied by alpha again. A half-opaque red fitted to a
quarter-opaque dark red. Fully opaque art was unharmed -- alpha 255 is the
identity for that arithmetic -- which is why the defect survived every fixture
this project had.

Three modules carried byte-identical copies of the expression, so all three are
exercised here through their own public entry points.
