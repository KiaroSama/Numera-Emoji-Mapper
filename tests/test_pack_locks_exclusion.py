"""Two processes must never hold one pack-family lock at the same time.

F08. The lock used to decide ownership by reading a file, comparing a token and
unlinking -- and its own recovery path could seat two publishers at once:

    A reads the dead holder's record and judges it stale
    A pauses, about to unlink
    B reads the SAME record, unlinks, claims, verifies its token, ENTERS
    A resumes, unlinks B's LIVE claim, claims, verifies its token, ENTERS

Two real processes reproduced it holding the same lock for 1.5 seconds. Every
guard in that protocol was a compare-then-act on a file another process can
change in between, so no further check could have closed it; the lock is an OS
lock now, held for the whole critical section.

These are real subprocesses on purpose. The defect is about what two operating
system processes can do to one file, and an in-process fake cannot fail the way
the bug failed. Each child journals the interval it believed it owned the lock,
and the assertions are about OVERLAP -- the only thing that actually matters.
