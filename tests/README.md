# Tests

Build the required native module first with the project interpreter:
`python scripts/build_native.py` (Rust 1.99+ and the platform linker required).
CI builds a release wheel before every Python job that uses the catalog/panel.
`test_native_similarity.py` compares exact indices against source-generated
fixtures, checks fixture drift, malformed inputs and missing-native failures.
The Python oracle is test-only, never a production fallback. Regenerate fixtures
with `python -m tests._similarity_oracle`; changes require reviewing source parity.
Rust formatting, clippy, unit checks and a repeated benchmark run once in the
3.11 build job; native parity also runs on Windows and Python 3.12/3.14.

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests -t . -p "test_*.py"
```

**`-t .` is required.** Without it the tests directory becomes the top-level,
modules load as `test_x` instead of `tests.test_x`, and `tests/__init__.py`
never runs — which disables the guard described below.
One module: `python -m unittest tests.test_x -v` — never `python tests/test_x.py`,
which skips the guard and now refuses to start.
`SuiteIsHermetic.test_the_guard_was_installed_before_the_test_modules` fails
loudly if the suite is started without it, and names the correct command.

That canary reads a flag sampled **while the test modules were being imported**,
not the live state of the patch. The earlier form asked whether `socket.connect`
was patched at assert time — but one test does `import tests`, so the package
installed itself mid-run and the canary passed while the real `.env` values had
already been read into the environment. A check something later can satisfy
cannot fail at the moment it is needed.

Tests use Python's stdlib `unittest` (no extra dependencies). Video tests are
skipped automatically when `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` are not on `PATH`.

Four modules are the exception: `test_panel_browser.py`,
`test_panel_queues.py`, `test_panel_curation.py` and `test_panel_perf.py` need
playwright and a Chromium build, and they **raise** rather than skipping when
those are missing — a browser test that reports green on a machine with no
browser is worse than no browser test at all. All four reach the page through `_panel_browser_fixtures.py`, which is also what
`test_ci_coverage.py` watches.

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m playwright install chromium
```

Set `NUMERA_EMOJI_MAPPER_NO_BROWSER_TESTS=1` to opt out on purpose. CI does exactly
that in the Python matrix and runs all four in its own `panel-browser:` job
instead: they test JavaScript, so once per Python version would download
Chromium twice to prove the same thing. That job names its modules explicitly
rather than globbing, so `test_ci_coverage.py` fails if a new browser suite is
added without being listed there.

A third job, `windows-safety:`, runs the suites whose behaviour Linux and WSL
cannot exercise — native file-handle locks, migration replay and rollback over
real paths, atomic plan writes, the decoder subprocess and the CLI entry points
— plus the sandbox clone, whose ownership lease and colon-bearing media
filenames only mean anything where a colon opens an alternate data stream —
on an ephemeral `windows-latest` runner. Which suites those are is a
judgement rather than a property of the code, so each one declares it with a
module-level `RUNS_ON_NATIVE_WINDOWS = True`, and `test_ci_coverage.py`
enforces the match in both directions: a marked suite missing from the job, and
a name in the job that no longer marks itself, each fail.

## The suite never touches the real network

`tests/__init__.py` runs before any test module and scrubs every
token/API-key-shaped environment variable, points `TELEGRAM_API_BASE` at the
discard port, stops `emojikit.build_pack.load_env()` from reading `.env`, and refuses
outbound sockets to anything but loopback (`NetworkAccessDenied`).

The `.env` half no longer depends on that file running at all:
`emojikit.build_pack.load_env()` refuses to read `.env` whenever a test runner owns the
process, decided from the entry point's own `__spec__`. The package-level scrub
could only remove credential-*shaped* names and only protected what was imported
after it, so anything else in `.env` stayed visible for a whole run.

This exists because a test meant only to check a CLI usage error once reached
live Telegram and replaced a sticker in a published pack. Inject a fake session
rather than adding an opt-out.

## Layout

| File | Covers |
|------|--------|
| `test_media.py` | format detection (`emojikit/media.py`) and identity (`emojikit/identity.py`): content/perceptual hashing, `same_image`, static→PNG, GIF→WEBM, Lottie→TGS, and the animated contract (512×512 canvas, frame rate, duration, gzip packaging, bounded decompression) |
| `test_media_reencode.py` | owner rule 1 — never republish another pack's file byte-for-byte — and the requirement pulling against it: the result must be pixel-identical, because the content key is computed from decoded pixels and a lossy re-compress would split one catalog row into two. Also `same_image` across a re-encode |
| `test_media_bounds.py` | the bounds around ingest: decompression limits, the perceptual-hash threshold range, and the signed storage conversion |
| `test_media_fitting.py` | `fit_100` must not touch opacity. It pasted the image using ITSELF as the mask — a composite against the transparent canvas, so colour came back multiplied by alpha and alpha squared |
| `test_identity_video.py` | video identity: alpha is part of the picture, and the two fingerprint APIs sample the same way. ffmpeg's default `vp9` decoder drops the alpha layer in silence, so the decoder is chosen from the PROBED codec, never the extension. Real VP9/VP8 encodes |
| `test_lottie_repaint.py` | `validate_tgs` against a timeline that is not a number (NaN defeats every comparison), and `repaint_in_place` against the two shapes it silently skipped: a keyframed colour and a gradient's opacity ramp |
| `test_catalog.py` | catalog dedup (exact + perceptual), `file_unique_id` skip, pending/upload tracking, persistence |
| `test_media_paths.py` | media paths survive a folder move: in-folder paths stored relative to the data folder, archive paths absolute, an older catalog converted once (absolute and project-relative rows), a converted one left alone, and a direct SQL reader resolving exactly like the catalog |
| `test_catalog_order.py` | the manual publish order (the `position` column) shared by the panel's drag-and-drop and `build_collection`'s publish order |
| `test_migration_provenance.py` | Legacy CLI recovery requires unambiguous immutable identifiers across snapshots; reused paths/slots, conflicting identifiers and missing provenance cannot rewrite required references |
| `test_ingest_retention.py` | Both fake-Telegram CLI paths preserve complete refused VP9 downloads and provenance after scratch cleanup, without replacing sentinels or binding identifiers |
| `test_video_collision_ingest.py` | Native-frame video identity through all ingest paths, exact/near merge and recovery, including brief/VFR differences, extra tails, remux/re-encode, reopen/resume and occupied destinations |
| `test_identity_migration.py` | `emojikit/collection_migrate.py` + `scripts/identity_repair.py`: moving EVERY durable reference to a content key when the decoder changes what that key IS — three tables, the derived `phash`, the publisher state and plan files, and the archived filenames that embed `key[:12]`. The properties under test are the refusals and the recoveries: a collision stops it rather than merging two rows, an unreadable row stops it rather than half-converting, the backup is taken through SQLite's online API (a `copy2` of a WAL database opens as `no such table: items`), a crash between any two stages resumes because every stage is idempotent, and a second run is a verified no-op |
| `test_state_artifacts.py` | a curation plan is live state, not an expendable sidecar: one inventory decides which JSON migration and rollback must carry, and only schema-defined ID fields are remapped — free-text labels are left alone even when they look like keys |
| `test_sqlite_snapshot.py` | real BUSY/LOCKED contention: a snapshot refuses inside its budget instead of waiting forever, the destination's original data survives that refusal, and a retry succeeds once the lock is released |
| `test_migration_lifecycle.py` | A03-A06: native actual-writer exclusion, pending-journal refusal, destination collisions, CLI replay after SQLite/JSON/media faults and real process death, complete rollback with unchanged-pack reconciliation, and final missing/decode/reference refusals. Decoder values are injected only for bookkeeping; SQLite, files, native processes and HTTP saves remain real. |
| `test_video_identity_fidelity.py` | identity-grade decoding either carries a video's alpha or refuses. A missing `libvpx-vp9`, a failed codec probe and a container naming no codec all used to answer "no decoder needed", which drops the alpha layer — two clips differing only in opacity then share one key, and `Catalog.add` merges them and deletes the file it merged away. Real VP9 and VP8 encodes |
| `test_video_timeline_comparison.py` | `same_image` on video compares the whole timeline, not frame zero. Two clips sharing ten opening frames used to compare equal; so did two differing in exactly one frame, because the identity stream is sampled at 10 fps and the content-key shortcut answered from that. Ends at `_resolve_sticker_key`, asserting no foreign id is written |
| `test_resume_safety.py` | the duplicate-upload paths, driven through `emojikit.build_pack.main()`: recorded-cursor resume, write-ahead in-flight record, atomic state writes, refusal to guess on unexplained drift, per-set limits |
| `test_unresolved_mutation.py` | the same engine when the live state is UNKNOWN: an ambiguous create, an unresolved in-flight record, a recorded set that no longer reads back. The guarantee is that the run stops rather than guess |
| `test_telegram_client.py` | `telegram_api.Telegram` on its own: token redaction, the STICKERSET_INVALID retry scope, and what the client accepts as evidence that an upload landed |
| `test_pack_locks.py` | `packstate.exclusive_lock` mechanics: refusal, release on error, stale reclaim and its races, ownership, heartbeat, and the lock-path helpers. (`test_lock_order.py` checks the documented ORDER of the same locks, by AST.) |
| `test_pack_locks_exclusion.py` | that two real processes never hold one pack-family lock at once. The old recovery path could seat two publishers: it decided ownership by reading a file, comparing a token and unlinking, and an unlinked inode is a lock nobody else can see. Two genuine subprocesses, not threads |
| `test_rebuild_dedup_state.py` | the `coins/rebuild_dedup.py` delete phase (an old pack that survived deletion must not complete it), the link message's retry bound, and the owner id parsed at import |
| `test_rebuild_dedup_resume.py` | resuming the rebuild after an interruption, decided by identity: an ambiguous upload stops the run, a failed live read is not "0 stickers", an in-flight upload and an adopted create are proven by content |
| `test_rebuild_dedup_plan.py` | the frozen plan, the cursor that walks it and the state schema; the `build` command's exit (saved cursor on trailing skips, partial while an upload is unresolved) |
| `test_rebuild_dedup_locks.py` | one rebuild per pack family: the lock keyed on the pack base, taken and released around every run |
| `test_rebuild_dedup_map.py` | the second phase of the same module: `map_and_fill` resolving `ticker_to_id.json` by image identity under the map lock, and the shared-logo-group guard |
| `test_publish_dedup.py` | verified retries for non-idempotent Bot API calls, live-set reconcile, adopt-on-occupied, recorded fuids |
| `test_build_collection_state.py` | `build_collection`'s state machine: plan/state files failing closed, live-set drift, identity on a recorded position and the unattributed tail |
| `test_publish_cli.py` | the same publisher at its CLI boundary: argument validation, `--new-set`/`--into-pack`, and `main()` end to end. Both halves drive `_CatalogFixture` |
| `test_publish_contracts.py` | the publisher contracts that are NOT collection state: pack titles as one sequence, the mixed-family layout, the blank-video guard, and the announcement path all three publishers share |
| `test_publish_invariants.py` | two invariants the publisher states but only enforced in one place each: a set that closed mid-run is never appended to on the next item, and the blank-media check gets the ITEM's format rather than the family's, so `--mixed` cannot bypass it |
| `test_preflight_outcomes.py` | preflight may not report acceptance it never obtained. The old counter counted ATTEMPTS, so a run in which every `check_uploadable` failed at the transport reported "all accepted" |
| `test_reconcile_uniqueness.py` | unique attribution means every rival was EXCLUDED. With two candidates matching one live sticker the function correctly reported ambiguity — and deleting one candidate's FILE made it answer "unique" with the survivor, so removing evidence promoted a guess to a certainty |
| `test_reconcile_identity.py` | recovery must never give a stranger's picture our item's identity. dHash is a grayscale STRUCTURE hash — an opaque red square and an opaque blue one are zero apart — so a perceptual match may only NOMINATE; content verification decides, and "more than one" and "could not examine" stay distinct from "no match" |
| `test_brand_logo.py` | the mandatory logo-first behaviour in `build_collection`: its conversion per format, and that no default logo or bot list survives in source |
| `test_operator_config.py` | the operator's identities come only from configuration: an unset key stops naming itself, empty `BRAND_LOGO_BOTS` means none, a listed bot needs an existing logo |
| `test_pack_manifest.py` | the `packs/` roster: what it records, and when it admits to being stale |
| `test_pack_archive.py` | when a FULL pack earns an archive move, and when the archive has stopped being true |
| `test_sync_order.py` | reordering an already-published pack with `setStickerPositionInSet`, which moves a sticker without re-uploading it, so every `custom_emoji_id` survives |
| `test_entry_point_contracts.py` | exit codes and argument validation at the CLI boundary of `fetch_pack`, `make_emoji_pngs`, `panel` and `logsetup` |
| `test_entry_points.py` | every executable imports cleanly in its own interpreter, and the suite's hermetic guard was installed before the test modules were imported |
| `test_fetch_emoji_ids.py` | premium-id extraction and de-duplication in the collector |
| `test_fetch_pack_limit.py` | `fetch_pack --limit N` delivers N NEW items — counting already-known stickers against the cap made a re-run a no-op |
| `test_make_emoji_pngs.py` | the image converter: blank guards, output freshness, source priority |
| `test_coin_cli_args.py` | the coin tools refuse an unrecognised argument instead of falling through to the live branch — a typo must not publish |
| `test_coin_logo_cache.py` | `fetch_logos` resume: a cached file is re-validated before it is trusted as a logo |
| `test_coin_http.py` | the one pooled `coins/_http.py` client: retry ladder, `Retry-After`, and the paging delay |
| `test_coin_providers.py` | the coin providers publishing logos: blank-logo refusal, the verified publish, and the canonical map re-read under the lock |
| `test_coin_recovery.py` | `fetch_paprika`'s unverified-upload recovery: an add that MAY be live is reconciled against the live set, never silently re-sent |
| `test_coin_ticker_map.py` | every writer of `ticker_to_id.json` — alias/enhance/provider — serialised so none loses another's update, and one inventory implementation |
| `test_remap_ids.py` | `coins/remap_ids.py`: a download cache that used to be trusted blindly, the `--apply` refusals, and the map written under the pack-family lock |
| `test_check_all_packs.py` | `coins/check_all_packs.py`: the audit report describes the LIVE packs, an analyse failure is an error retried next run (not a blank), and a throttled set listing is retried |
| `test_coin_keywords.py` | `coins/_keywords.py`, the one writer of `keywords.csv`: invalid PNGs are not listed, an empty name keeps the old one, a crash leaves the previous file whole |
| `test_contracts_shared.py` | the Python half of the Python↔Worker contracts, read from `fixtures/contracts/` (the Worker's `contracts.test.ts` reads the same files): the publish body, and the custom-emoji id syntax |
| `test_build_pack_announce.py` | `build_pack` announces finished packs as the bot whose token it publishes with |
| `test_cli_env.py` | reading `.env`: a file saved with a byte order mark keeps its first key |
| `test_telegram_body_shape.py` | a JSON body that is not an object goes through the client's retry and applied-check path instead of raising `AttributeError` |
| `test_launcher_contract.py` | every flag `run.ps1` (and `scripts/run-actions.ps1`) passes exists in that tool's `--help` |
| `test_cli_docs.py` | GUIDE §12, the CLI reference, against each tool's own `--help`: every flag documented, every documented flag real |
| `test_pack_rows.py` | the one renderer behind every "emoji in this pack" table, and its four writers: a pipe or a newline in a label is escaped, column headers unchanged |
| `test_pack_export.py` | `pack_archive --export`: a pack as a zip in slot order with its manifest, sources untouched, refused while the roster is stale or a file is missing |
| `test_status.py` | `emojikit.status`: offline, read-only; exit 3 and the fix command when the roster or archive is stale |
| `test_plan_status.py` | `emojikit.plan_status`: what the panel's saved pack plan would change, read-only, including the ids a move would retire |
| `test_plan_apply.py` | `emojikit.plan_apply` against a fake Telegram: the dry run writes nothing, 25 changes take two runs at the cap, a delete applied before a crash is settled and never re-sent, the next new pack leads with the logo, and every refusal (over cap, unknown key, per-format family, pack gap, unreadable set, held lock) changes nothing; plus `Catalog.unpublish` |
| `test_panel_perf.py` | the browser performance suite: real animated WebP previews, the 24-card budget nearest the centre, All visible, the scroll freeze, bounded zoomed-out windows, unchanged CSS variables, the pick-ring pause, bulk hold matching the item-by-item result. Each scenario prints one `PANEL_PERF` line; timings are printed, never asserted, counts are. Runs in the `panel-browser` job |
| `test_panel_startup.py` | the panel binds and opens the browser without waiting on a hanging bot-name lookup, and a panel already on the port is reopened, not rebuilt |
| `test_suite_guard.py` | every test module refuses a direct run (its `__main__` block), and `load_env()` treats an imported `unittest` as a test run and nothing else |
| `test_fetch_pack_ids.py` | `fetch_pack` given an emoji id fetches the pack it belongs to, once; an id that names no pack is reported |
| `test_verify_logos.py` | `verify_logos`: the inversion-aware distance, the durable replacement intent bound to its own `--map`, and the fix path's exit codes |
| `test_panel.py` | what `emojikit/panel.py` serves of the catalog: inert item JSON (no script breakout), the save-during-reorder window, an unavailable catalog, and saving from a filtered grid |
| `test_panel_view.py` | what `emojikit.panel_view.build_view` makes of the catalog: brand-logo preview, the similarity order, the tap-to-copy id, the published-item filter, the pack index travelling onto an already-live card so the grid can draw the boundary between two packs, and one pack unhidden on request |
| `test_panel_guard.py` | the POST guard (token, loopback Host/Origin, content type, body cap, exact-permutation order) and the two behaviours built on it. `MutationGuard` owns nine `test_*` methods and is subclassed twice, so all three classes must stay in one module — importing the base elsewhere would collect it again rather than move it |
| `test_panel_page_actions.py` | served-text contracts (`emojikit.panel.PAGE`, `emojikit.panel.SCRIPT`) for the editing gestures: drag-and-drop (every dragover edits the model and re-projects the grid, the drop records the dragstart snapshot, a cancel restores it, the pointer's side of a tile decides before-or-after, a carried card is parked rather than unmounted), undo/redo, and selection mode (a click drives the picks or `included`, the pick box owns its own click, a picked card's ring is a rotating transform that stops under reduced motion) |
| `test_panel_page_grid.py` | served-text contracts for the grid: the viewport observers and the scroll-time animation freeze, the virtual grid (only rows near the viewport exist, integer row arithmetic), zoom (buttons, Ctrl+wheel, a typeable percentage, clamping, compact below 75 %), the page actually shipping its scripts, the pack separators and the jump buttons. Shared text comes from `_panel_page_fixtures.py` (no test classes) |
| `test_panel_assets.py` | the scripts ship as real files, the page loads every one of them in order with a version that is their content hash (`emojikit.panel.ASSET_VER`), the icon URL carries its own content hash (`ICON_VER`, so a replaced logo is not served stale), the inline block carries values not behaviour, and `/static/<script>?v=…` reaches the file on disk (immutable-cached, so a stale script would otherwise be served forever) |
| `test_panel_sandbox.py` | that the test sandbox reaches neither the owner's data nor their account: the argument allowlist (a forwarded `--data-dir` used to win over the wrapper's own), a clone that shares no bytes and keeps no source path, the refusals that abandon a clone rather than finish one that points at production, and the ownership marker plus lease that stop one sandbox's start-up from deleting another's catalog |
| `test_sandbox_lifecycle.py` | that making a sandbox never writes to the source and that a live sandbox is never reclaimed: the source's journal mode, full dump and raw bytes unchanged on success and refusal; the project-relative media file chosen over a same-named decoy; same-length corruption and a source changed mid-copy refused; distinct keys never sharing a file; a sweep during construction and during serving removing nothing, then reclaiming after the real serving process dies; a real wrapper answering a real HTTP Save on the clone only. Native Windows |
| `test_atomic_state_files.py` | that a state write touches only its own temporary file: an unrelated `<name>.tmp` survives success and every injected failure; a failed write keeps the old content; two writers released together both finish; an existing file keeps its permissions (POSIX); Windows' transient refusal to replace is retried, and a persistent one still fails within its deadline. Native Windows |
| `test_panel_save_scope.py` | `POST /api/save` carries the FULL selection, so a request with no notion of scope speaks for rows the page never saw. The request now states what it was showing, the server applies the decision only inside that scope, and a page too old to say is refused with 409. Driven through the real handler on a real socket |
| `test_panel_queues.py` | what the panel still owes the server, on a fake clock: unsaved ticks are dirty even when no Save is in flight, an older acknowledgement cannot clear newer unsaved work, a permanent 400/409 stops resubmitting (its own comment said retrying could not fix it, and it retried anyway), the 5-second heartbeat obeys the backoff instead of walking past it, and a fetch that never resolves is released by a raced deadline rather than claiming the queue forever |
| `test_panel_curation.py` | Real browser controls: Shift picks, held-card removal/counts, per-card/all release, full-pack refusal, drag Undo/Redo, original-slot restoration, explicit Save checkpoints, Reset history and real SQLite reload. Selection by hand in BOTH surfaces -- a click anywhere on a card picks it, in the tray and in the grid, Shift takes the range, the pick box still toggles exactly once, an unpicked box draws no check and a picked card wears the moving ring. And the pack a drop joins: the card the pointer was AIMED at decides it, for a drag out of the tray and a drag inside the grid alike, a drop that aimed at nothing stamps nothing, and a drop into an unnumbered run invents no number. Classes share the page fixture through a `PanelPage` mixin, never by subclassing a `TestCase` -- that made unittest collect the parent's tests again per subclass |
| `test_panel_instance.py` | reopening a panel reuses its own server instead of failing a second bind, and tells an unrelated listener on the port apart from one of ours |
| `test_panel_plan.py` | the move plan as a pure function: what counts as a move, what is merely held, what is absent because the page had no opinion, and the merge that keeps out-of-scope decisions while dropping the ones about emoji the catalog no longer has |
| `test_panel_intent_persistence.py` | the saved layout survives, through the real HTTP handler and SQLite: repeated Save/reload/Save, a partial view that merges instead of overwriting, an older client that sends no `packs`, a legacy plan carrying only `moves`, invalid/duplicate/out-of-scope targets, and a malformed plan that is preserved rather than replaced with an empty one |
| `test_panel_logging.py` | Bounded UI event schema accepts diagnostics and rejects private/arbitrary fields or invalid numeric values before writing any log |
| `test_panel_preview.py` | Real HTTP previews: requested size/rate, cache reuse, single-frame posters for all formats, VP9 alpha preservation and invalid-resource-budget refusal |
| `test_ci_coverage.py` | the browser job runs from a hand-maintained list of module names, so this fails when a suite imports the harness without being named there — and asserts none is run twice |
| `test_fake_contracts.py` | every test double whose method shadows a `Telegram` method must accept what the real client passes. `FakeTelegram.send_message()` rejected `disable_preview`, so every happy-path announcement in two suites was silently exercising the swallowed error path while the tests stayed green |
| `test_panel_browser.py` | what the panel's client code actually DOES, in headless Chromium: the save pipeline's revisioned queues, the separator nodes, the zoom anchor, the animation freeze, the pack count, and a denied `localStorage`. A source-text assertion cannot tell a correct implementation of any of these from a broken one. Needs `requirements-dev.txt` and `python -m playwright install chromium`; set `NUMERA_EMOJI_MAPPER_NO_BROWSER_TESTS=1` to opt out deliberately, never to make a missing browser look green |
| `test_panel_server.py` | the panel as a process: which Host may reach it, and who owns the port. Real subprocesses and real sockets, so the slowest of the four |
| `test_repaintable.py` | the `--repaintable` gate: the flag is read off the STICKER not the set, only an explicit yes proceeds, `skip`/`keep` never prompt, and an unanswerable prompt (EOF, Ctrl-C) is a no rather than a crash. Also `--tint`, which bakes the repaint instead of skipping: colour parsing, a Lottie recoloured through its tree (fills, strokes and gradient stops, offsets kept), a static filled through its alpha, video refused, and the tint recorded on the item |
| `test_emoji_bot.py` | the bot's pure helpers: entity extraction and reply building |
| `test_logsetup.py` | secret redaction, plus a guard that fails if any `.env` secret value appears in a git-tracked file |

`_pack_fixtures.py`, `_rebuild_fixtures.py`, `_cli_fixtures.py`,
`_bc_fixtures.py`, `_panel_fixtures.py`, `_media_fixtures.py`,
`_panel_browser_fixtures.py` and `_coin_fixtures.py` hold the
fakes shared by the modules above them (the PNG builders, `FakeTelegram`,
`RebuildCase`, and the standalone-script loader every entry-point contract
module imports). One copy each, because a duplicated fake drifts away from the
thing it stands in for. The leading underscore is load-bearing:
`-p "test_*.py"` must not collect them as test modules. `_media_fixtures.py`
holds `make_png` (a block on transparency, any size) and `encode_vp9` (numbered
frames to an alpha-keeping WebM), which the publisher and video suites share;
`_cli_fixtures.cli_help` runs a tool's `--help` without writing a log file.

**Deprecations fail.** `tests/__init__.py` turns a `DeprecationWarning` issued
by the project's own code (`emojikit`, `coins`, `scripts`, `tests`) into an
error, so a removal shows up one release early; third-party warnings stay
warnings.

**Run chosen suites with the gate, not a hand-written command:**
`.\scripts\check.ps1 -Tests test_catalog,test_panel_plan -SkipCompile -SkipLint`
runs them as `tests.<name>`, so the guard above still applies.

A fixture may only be shared if it carries no `test_*` methods and no
TestCase base. One that does multiplies with every importer instead of
moving — which is why `MutationGuard` stays whole in `test_panel_guard.py`.

**Patch the namespace the CALLER reads, not the one that defines the name.**
`build_pack` does `from telegram_api import Telegram`, so the name lives in
`build_pack`'s globals and `patch.object(telegram_api, "Telegram")` leaves
the real client in place — the suite then dials the discard port and sleeps
through the retry ladder. `announce_via_worker` is the mirror image: its
only caller is `announce.announce_packs`, so it must be patched on
`announce`.

`FakeTelegram` binds the **real** `emojikit.build_pack.Telegram.send_message` rather than
reimplementing it. The retry count and the link-preview flag are guarantees
those tests assert, and a hand-written copy would keep asserting them long after
the shipped method stopped providing them.

## The Cloudflare Worker has its own suite

`worker/` is TypeScript and is **not** collected by the command above, nor by
`scripts\check.ps1` — running it needs Node, which nothing else in this project
does. Run it yourself after touching `worker/`:

```powershell
cd worker
npm ci               # exactly the committed lockfile, like CI
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npx vitest run       # the Worker's own suite
```

Same hermetic rule, enforced the same way: the tests stub `fetch`, so nothing in
them can reach Telegram. CI runs these in a dedicated `worker:` job — separate
from the Python matrix, which needs Python and ffmpeg and would otherwise run
this suite once per Python version.

## Fixtures

| Fixture | Purpose | Safe to commit |

| `fixtures/lottie/red_circle_512.json` | minimal valid 512×512 Lottie animation used to exercise TGS packaging/validation and animated content hashing. 512×512 is Telegram's required canvas for animated emoji — a 100×100 fixture would encode the wrong contract | yes (synthetic, no secrets) |
| `fixtures/contracts/publish_request.json` | the exact body `announce_via_worker` sends; read by `test_contracts_shared.py` and `worker/test/contracts.test.ts`, so either side changing it breaks both | yes (synthetic, neutral names) |
| `fixtures/contracts/emoji_messages.json` | messages and typed id lists with the ids each side must extract | yes (synthetic) |

Static images and animated GIFs used by the tests are generated on the fly with
Pillow in temporary directories and are **not** committed. No network access or
real Telegram credentials are required to run the suite.
