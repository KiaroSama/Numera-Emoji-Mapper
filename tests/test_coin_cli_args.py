"""Argument parsing on the coin CLIs, where the default branch is destructive.

`fetch_paprika`, `fetch_cmc` and `fetch_logos` all have a switch that decides
between a dry run and one that spends API quota, uploads with the owner's
credentials and rewrites the canonical ticker map. Nothing behind it asks for
confirmation, so an argument the parser does not recognise has to be a refusal.

These drive `main` directly, so no test here can reach a network.
