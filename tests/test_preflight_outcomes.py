"""Preflight may not report acceptance it never obtained.

F10. The old counter counted ATTEMPTS. A transport failure was logged as a
warning and then forgotten, so a run in which every single `check_uploadable`
call failed to reach Telegram printed "Every queued file is acceptable to
Telegram" and exited 0 having validated nothing at all. Someone reads that and
starts a 200-upload publish.

Four outcomes now, counted apart: accepted, refused (Telegram gave a verdict),
missing (never reached Telegram), and unknown (we could not ask). Unknown is
neither an accepted file nor a permanent rejection, and it never borrows the
exit code of either.

No network: `check_uploadable` is the only Telegram call preflight makes, and a
stub records exactly what it was asked.
