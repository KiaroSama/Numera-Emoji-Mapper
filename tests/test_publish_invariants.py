"""Two invariants the publisher states but only checked in one place each.

Both came out of the audit's adjacent-path list rather than its numbered
findings, and both were confirmed by driving the real `publish_format`.

**A closed set stayed the target.** When adoption found live stickers this
publisher cannot attribute, it logged, counted a failure and moved on -- but
left `in_set` at the reconciled count. The NEXT pending item therefore took the
ordinary add branch and appended to the very set just judged unsafe. One item
was protected; every item after it was not. `_set_is_open` is now asked before
every add.

**`--mixed` switched off the blank-media guard.** `_media_ok(path, fmt)` was
handed the FAMILY format. Under `--mixed` that is "mixed", which matches
neither the static branch nor the video branch, so the function returned True
for everything -- in exactly the layout this project publishes with.
