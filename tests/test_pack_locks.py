"""The file locks that keep two publishers off one pack family.

Split out of `test_resume_safety` because these exercise a different mechanism
entirely: `exclusive_lock` and the lock-path helpers. Nothing here reads a
resume state file, fakes Telegram or needs an image -- the subject is purely
which process may hold which lock, and when a dead holder's claim may be taken.

`test_lock_order` is the sibling that checks the documented ORDER of these locks
by walking the AST; this one checks the mechanics of taking and releasing them.
