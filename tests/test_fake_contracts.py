"""C01: a test double must accept what the real client accepts.

The successful Python 3.11 CI log carried this line over and over:

    FakeTelegram.send_message() got an unexpected keyword argument 'disable_preview'

`announce_packs` passes `disable_preview`, two fakes did not take it, and the
call sites swallow a failed notification on purpose -- a channel post must not
sink a finished publish. So every happy-path announcement in those suites was
silently exercising the ERROR path, and the tests were green because nothing
asserted the message had actually been sent.

Fixing the two fakes is not the fix; the next one drifts the same way. The real
guard is mechanical: compare each fake's signature against the client it stands
in for. `_bc_fixtures.FakeTG` being correct was never evidence about the others.

AST, not import: pulling every test module in would execute them, and the point
is a cheap structural check that runs even when a suite is broken.
