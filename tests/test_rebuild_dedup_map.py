"""The canonical map phase of coins/rebuild_dedup.py.

The second half of the module: once the packs are built, `map_and_fill` reads
the live sets and rewrites `ticker_to_id.json` from what it finds. It is a
distinct phase with its own failure mode and its own lock discipline (the
pack-family lock FIRST, the canonical map lock second, held across the whole
read-then-write span), so it is tested apart from the mutation walk in
`test_rebuild_dedup_state`.

* the canonical map rebuilt from a snapshot read before the locks (A),
* a same-length reorder or replacement mapped by POSITION -- this is exactly
  how the Solama memecoin llama got published as `sol`,
* one emoji id shared by a crowd of tickers, the signature that drift leaves.

No network and no real sleeps: Telegram is a fake object.
