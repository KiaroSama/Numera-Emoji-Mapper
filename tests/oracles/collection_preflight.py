"""Ask Telegram to validate every queued file before anything is published.

Split out of `build_collection` because it is a separate job with a separate
verdict: it uploads nothing, publishes nothing and changes no state -- it only
answers "would Telegram take these files?" -- and it has its own exit-code
contract, which is the whole subject of F10.

``uploadStickerFile`` runs the same validator as ``addStickerToSet`` and touches
no set, so a file Telegram will refuse can be found in seconds instead of at
whatever minute of the publish it happens to reach. One `.tgs` with a subtract
mask was found 46 minutes into a run, after 99 uploads and two flood waits, and
it would have been the very first thing this reported.
